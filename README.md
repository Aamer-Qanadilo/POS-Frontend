## Overview

This project is a web-based point-of-sale system (POS) designed for use in supermarkets. The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows supermarkets to add products to a cart and calculate the total amount for the order.

With this system, supermarkets can keep track of their inventory, manage customer orders, and process payments more efficiently. The app is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it an ideal solution for businesses of all sizes.

The POS system is built using modern web technologies, ensuring that it is fast, reliable, and scalable. Overall, this project aims to simplify the process of managing customer orders and streamlining the checkout process for supermarkets.

NOTE: This system is implemented for both Frontend and Backend. So in order for this to work flawlessly you will have to download the Backend from here
